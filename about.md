Hey stalker, thanks for dropping by. This page was created specifically
for you! I am a software engineer living in the Philadelphia suburbs.
Sure, I have a bunch of other hobbies; but we're here to talk tech.

I knew I wanted to be a programmer at age 12, after a family visit to my
father's office, at IBM. We toured the raised floor areas around the
huge mainframe computers, watched tapes spin and whirl--just like in the
movies, and large printers spewing green-bar paper with endless reports.
It wasn't the impressive hardware that I found intriguing, but the
little Tic-Tac-Toe and Star Trek game on the terminals. Something, my
mind shouted, or someone told the computer what to do and how to do it! 
So you can see I was immediately hooked.

After [High School](http://www.montroseareasd.k12.pa.us/) and
[College](http://lhup.edu), I got my first job, not programming Star
Trek games, but working with COBOL. Oddly, I didn't do nightly batch
transactional reporting, but instead worked for a
TV Listings publisher, doing of all things, string manipulation and
layout formatting, and pushing that data to typesetting systems.

After that, I did work with other publishing systems, financial systems
(where I finally did get to touch the overnight transactional processing
systems), and stumbled into the Startup field in the late 1990's.

I downloaded Netscape Navigator 0.96b, my first encounter with the
internet, and again, I was hooked. Nothing before allowed people to
connect to information on this nascent Wold-Wide Web. I found a free
(but long-distance--still expensive back then) SLIP/PPP dial up account
to access this Internet and I explored all there was, the CIA website,
gopher, FTP, and the Usenet. 

After moving to NYC in 1997, I took a job working at
[theglobe.com](https://www.google.com/search?q=theglobe.com+ipo), 
an early community website offering chat, forums, email,
clubs, and news feeds. It was a great group of people, I learned a lot
from them, and enjoyed working plugged-in with the internet.

After the 2001 dot-com bubble popped, I took up work with a new email
list hosting company called [Biglist](http://biglist.com), and
single-handedly wrote software that cut out new territory in the
internet chapter. We were awarded US Patent [7315883](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=7315883.PN.&OS=PN/7315883&RS=PN/7315883)
for “System and method for mailing list mediation”: methods for generating dynamic mailing lists.

Even since then, I get excited about the possibilities that the current
internet can give us: smart phones, social networks, and the better
methods of web development: AJAX, Javascript Frameworks, and connected
everything together with the internet.

I am a technologist, but also a pragmatist. The shiny new thing is only
exciting when it fills a real need. I discovered this back in 2005 or
so, when I read about Ruby on Rails, and was instantly wowed. The ruby
language was beautiful, and DHH's opinionated framework ushered in a
new age of web development. We can solve real problems still, but in
less time, and actually smile while doing it!

I still look forward everyday to building new and better solutions to old 
problems, making the users of my code as happy as I am writing it. I am
excited about the next 20 years as I am of the last!

If you need to reach me, contact me by email at the CURRENT_YEAR (1999
if this was that year) at allenfair.com and say "Hi!"
