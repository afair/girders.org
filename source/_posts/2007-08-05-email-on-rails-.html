<p>I am giving a talk this evening at the <a href="http://phillyonrails.org/">Philly On Rails</a> meeting on an introduction to email and sending and receiving email with a Ruby on Rails application.</p>
<p>I am referencing the <a href="http://allenfair.com/email-on-rails.pdf">slides</a> and a <a href="http://allenfair.com/mailapp.tgz">sample application</a> in case anyone needs to reference them!</p>
